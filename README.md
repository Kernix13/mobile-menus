# Accessible Mobile Menus Project

## Brief descrition of the project

The project is to create different mobile menus that are accessible.

- There are 4 menus on this page that will have different entrances for mobile.
- The menus are accessible due to toggling of the ARIA attribute <code>aria-expanded</code>.
- Mobile menu 1 is the only one that is working.
- Mobile menu 2 (below) is meant to slide in from the right but I need to redo the JavaScript.
- Next will be mobile menu 3 that goes from the top.
- And the last one will be mobile menu 4 which fills the entire screen with a centered vertical menu.

> Just download the files and open `index.html` in the browser. I set the media query breakpoing high (`962px`) so you can just minify the browser window add test the first menu. Use DevTools to see the toggling of `true`/`false` for the `aria-expanded` attribute on the `<button>`.
